# Advent of Code 2022

[AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/)

Here are my solutions for the Advent of Code challenge for 2022.
Let's see if I make it to the end!

Last year I made it through day 21 before running into trouble, and ended up with 45 / 50 stars.

I'm using Python again to freshen up and hopefully learn a thing or two along the way.

If you're taking on the challenge too, say hi and let me know how you're doing!
